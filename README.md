# CustomizeWeddingAttire
Stardew Valley mod to let you customize what you wear at weddings.

# What This Mod Does
Normally, in Stardew Valley, when there is a wedding:
* If you selected the "male" body type (whether you're getting married or in the audience), you are put into a tuxedo.
* If you selected the "female" body type, your clothing remains the same.

This mod changes this, so that when there is a wedding:
* If you select the ``Tuxedo`` option in the config, you are put into a tuxedo outfit.
* If you select the ``WeddingDress`` option in the config, you are put into a wedding dress outfit.
* If you select the ``NoClothingChange`` option in the config, your clothing is whatever you were wearing right before the wedding.
* If you select the ``GameDefault`` option in the config, your clothing decisions follow the default game logic.

In a multiplayer game, if one of the players wants to wear a different option from the default, the other players will also need to have this mod in order to see them wear the right clothing.

# How To Install
* Install SMAPI, if you don't already have it installed
